# Project: Morphex Rotating Arm

This is a WIP project I'm working on. It'll take years to gather knowledge and the budget to actually build it.

## TODO
1. Remodel brackets and servo.
2. Think about materials more.
3. Cost analysis.

## Costs
**15/12/2024 01:49:**
- $131.50 for Morphex Rotating Arm
- $58.58 for 1x Servo and 1x Serial Servo Controller

**Total:** $190.08

## Progress
**15/12/2024 01:48:**
- I have a working model with the original servos. The model is usable and can be visualized.
- Electronics haven't been selected yet but [HiWonder Controller](https://www.hiwonder.com/products/serial-bus-servo-controller) and [HTS-35H Servos](https://www.hiwonder.com/collections/bus-servo/products/hts-35h) are good combos

**15/12/2024 13:30:**
- I have to wait until new years to buy a servo to measure it's dimensions and remodel the servo's CAD model 
- Haven't decided on materials yet, but cnc'ed aluminum for high stress parts and maybe ASA/ABS for the rest
